In order to protect the greatest number of PrestaShop stores, [Friends Of Presta](https://friendsofpresta.org/) publishes public security advisories and requests a CVE on the recommendations of agencies, hosts and merchants, if:
* A PrestaShop module or theme is highly exploited or explored for a malicious activity.
* The author of this module, although contacted, does not plan to publish a CVE or does not respond to requests for corrections.
* A critical vulnerability is not detectable by a WAF.

For more information, please contact: security/at/friendsofpresta.org
