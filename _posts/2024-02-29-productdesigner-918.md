* **Published at**: 2024-02-29
* **Platform**: PrestaShop
* **Product**: productdesigner
* **Impacted release**: < 1.178.36 (1.178.36 fixed the vulnerability)
* **Product author**: Tunis Soft
* **Weakness**: [CWE-918](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/918.html)
* **Severity**: critical (9.1)

## Description

In the Product Designer module from Tunis Soft for PrestaShop, an improper validation of `url` parameter in the method `ProductDesignerPixabayModuleFrontController::postProcess` can be executed via a trivial HTTP call to forge Server-Side Request. 

This vulnerability can be exploited to initiate a HTTP request and get the return, for instance, use the vulnerable website as proxy to attack others websites, exfiltrate data in files under IP restriction or perform a path traversal attack.

This exploit uses a PrestaShop front controller and most attackers can conceal the module controller's path during the exploit, so you will never know within your conventional frontend logs that it exploits this vulnerability. **You will only see "POST /" inside your conventional frontend logs.** Activating the AuditEngine of mod_security (or similar) is the only way to get data to confirm this exploit.
