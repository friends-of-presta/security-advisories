You can also install an adhoc module that verify and patch if necessary the vulnerability by following this [knowledge base](https://desk.202-ecommerce.com/portal/en/kb/articles/security-advisory-cve-2023-28843#How_tho_verify_if_my_module_is_vulnerable_).

## Other recommendations

* It’s recommended to upgrade the module beyond 3.16.3.
* Upgrade PrestaShop to the latest version to disable multiquery executions (separated by “;”) - be warned that this functionality **WILL NOT** protect your SHOP against injection SQL which uses the UNION clause to steal data.
* Change the default database prefix ps_ by a new longer arbitrary prefix. Nevertheless, be warned that this is useless against blackhats with DBA senior skill because of a design vulnerability in DBMS
* Activate OWASP 942’s rules on your WAF (Web application firewall), be warned that you will probably break your backoffice and you will need to pre-configure some bypasses against these set of rules.
