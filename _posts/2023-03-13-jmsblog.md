## Description

Several front controller in /controllers/front/ hold sensitives SQL calls that can be executed with a trivial http call and exploited to forge a blind SQL injection.

**WARNING** : This exploit is actively used to deploy webskimmer to massively steal credit cards. 

This exploit uses a PrestaShop front controller and most attackers can conceal the module controller's path during the exploit so you will never know within your conventional frontend logs that it exploits this vulnerability. **You will only see "POST /" inside your conventional frontend logs.** Activating the AuditEngine of mod_security (or similar) is the only way to get data to confirm this exploit.

## Other recommendations

* Upgrade PrestaShop to the latest version to disable multiquery executions (separated by “;”) - be warned that this functionality **WILL NOT** protect your SHOP against injection SQL which uses the UNION clause to steal data.
* Change the default database prefix `ps_` by a new longer arbitrary prefix. Nevertheless, be warned that this is useless against blackhats with DBA senior skill because of a design vulnerability in DBMS
* Activate OWASP 942's rules on your WAF (Web application firewall), be warned that you will probably break your backoffice and you will need to pre-configure some bypasses against these set of rules.
