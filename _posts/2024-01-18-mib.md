In the module mib from MyPresta.eu for PrestaShop, a guest can perform SQL injection in affected versions.


## Summary

* **CVE ID**: [CVE-2023-46351](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-46351)
* **Published at**: 2024-01-18
* **Platform**: PrestaShop
* **Product**: mib
* **Impacted release**: <= 1.6.0 (1.6.1 fixed the vulnerability)
* **Product author**: MyPresta.eu
* **Weakness**: [CWE-89](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html)
* **Severity**: critical (9.8)

## Description


The methods `mib::getManufacturersByCategory()` has sensitive SQL calls that can be executed with a trivial http call and exploited to forge a SQL injection.

There is a prerequisite to exploit this vulnerability : "Activate categories filter" configuration must be set to enable which is not the default configuration.

This exploit uses a specific payload and most attackers can conceal the payload during the exploit, so you will never know within your conventional frontend logs that it exploits this vulnerability. **You will only see "POST /" inside your conventional frontend logs.** Activating the AuditEngine of mod_security (or similar) is the only way to get data to confirm this exploit.

## Possible malicious usage

* Obtain admin access
* Remove data from the associated PrestaShop
* Copy/paste data from sensitive tables to FRONT to expose tokens and unlock admins's ajax scripts
* Rewrite SMTP settings to hijack emails


## Patch from 1.5.6

```diff
--- 1.5.6/modules/mib/mib.php
+++ 1.6.1/modules/mib/mib.php
...
            'WHERE 1 ' .
-           ('AND cp.`id_category` ='. $category) . ' ' .
+           ('AND cp.`id_category` ='. (int) $category) . ' ' .
            ($active ? 'AND m.`active` = 1 ' : '') .
...
```

## Other recommendations

* It’s recommended to upgrade to the latest version of the module **mib**.
* Upgrade PrestaShop to the latest version to disable multiquery executions (separated by “;”) - be warned that this functionality **WILL NOT** protect your SHOP against injection SQL which uses the UNION clause to steal data.
* Change the default database prefix `ps_` with a new longer, arbitrary prefix. Nevertheless, be warned that this is useless against blackhats with DBA senior skill because of a design vulnerability in DBMS
* Activate OWASP 942's rules on your WAF (Web application firewall), be warned that you will probably break your backoffice and you will need to pre-configure some bypasses against this set of rules.
