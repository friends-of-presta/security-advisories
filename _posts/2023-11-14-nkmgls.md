severity: "critical (9.0)"
---

In the module "NKM GLS" (nkmgls) up to version 3.0.1 from Nukium for PrestaShop, a guest (authenticated customer) can perform XSS injection of type 2 (stored XSS) from FRONT to BACK (F2B) of Category 2 within the funnel order in affected versions.

Note : To succeed in this exploit, the red team needs to pay to convert a cart into a valid order with GLS carrier and require the administrator of the PS to check a specific screen within its backoffice.

## Summary

* **CVE ID**: [CVE-2023-47309](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-47309)
* **Published at**: 2023-11-14
* **Platform**: PrestaShop
* **Product**: nkmgls
* **Impacted release**: <= 3.0.1 (3.0.2 fixed the vulnerability)
* **Product author**: Nukium
* **Weakness**: [CWE-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)
* **Severity**: critical (9.0)

## Description

As all [XSS type 2 (Stored XSS) F2B (Front to Back)](https://security.friendsofpresta.org/modules/2023/02/07/stored-xss.html), there are two steps and a prerequisite.

Prerequisite : 
- The field `phone_mobile` within table gls_cart_carrier suffers from a type varchar(255) which is large enough to allow dangerous XSS payloads.

Steps : 
- The method `NkmGlsCheckoutModuleFrontController::displayAjaxSavePhoneMobile` does not properly clean the parameter `gls_customer_mobile`. pSQL is useless against XSS which exploits HTML tag attributes (Category 2 according to OWASP - pSQL only neutralized Category 1 thanks to its strip_tags).
- The output in the backoffice is not escaped in the related smarty template that uses it.

## Other recommendations

* It’s recommended to upgrade to the latest version of the module **nkmgls**.
* Systematically escape characters ' " < and > by replacing them with HTML entities and applying strip_tags - Smarty and Twig provide auto-escape filters :
  - Smarty: `{$value.comment|escape:'html':'UTF-8'}`
  - Twig:`{% raw %}{{value.comment|e}}{% endraw %}`
* Limit to the strict minimum the length's value in database - a database field that allow 10 characters (`varchar(10)`) is far less dangerous than a field that allows 40+ characters (use cases that can exploit fragmented XSS payloads are very rare)
* Configure CSP headers (content security policies) by listing external domains allowed to load assets (such as js files) or being called in XHR transactions (Ajax).
* If applicable: check against all your frontoffice's uploaders, uploading files that will be served by your server that mime type application/javascript (like every .js natively) must be strictly forbidden as it must be considered as dangerous as PHP files.
* Activate OWASP 941's rules on your WAF (Web application firewall) - be warned that you will probably break your frontoffice/backoffice and you will need to preconfigure some bypasses against this set of rules.
