* **Availability**: high

**Vector string**: [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

## Possible malicious usage

* Technical and personal data leaks
* Obtain admin access
* Remove all data of the linked PrestaShop

## Other recommandations

* It’s recommended to upgrade the module beyond 1.8.3.
* Upgrade PrestaShop beyond 1.7.8.8 (and 8.0.1) to disable multiquery executions (separated by “;”).
* Change the default database prefix ps_ by a new longer arbitrary prefix. Nethertheless, be warned that this is useless against blackhat with DBA senior skill because of a design vulnerability in DBMS
* Activate OWASP 942’s rules on your WAF (Web application firewall), be warned that you will probably break your backoffice and you will need to pre-configure some bypasses against these set of rules.
