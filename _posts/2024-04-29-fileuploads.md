## Summary

* **CVE ID**: [CVE-2024-33270](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-33270)
* **Published at**: 2024-04-29
* **Platform**: PrestaShop
* **Product**: fileuploads
* **Impacted release**: <= 2.0.3 (2.0.4 fixed the vulnerability)
* **Product author**: FME Modules
* **Weakness**: [CWE-359](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/359.html)
* **Severity**: medium (7.5), GDPR violation

## Description

Due to a lack of permissions control, a guest can download all files uploaded by customers which could be national identity card / contents under NDA, etc.

This exploit uses a PrestaShop front controller and most attackers can conceal the module controller's path during the exploit, so you will never know within your conventional frontend logs that it exploits this vulnerability. **You will only see "POST /" inside your conventional frontend logs.** Activating the AuditEngine of mod_security (or similar) is the only way to get data to confirm this exploit.
