In the module "Multi Accessories Pro" (hsmultiaccessoriespro) up to version 5.2.0 from Presta Monster for PrestaShop, a guest can perform SQL injection in affected versions.


## Summary

* **CVE ID**: [CVE-2023-50026](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-50026)
* **Published at**: 2024-02-08
* **Platform**: PrestaShop
* **Product**: hsmultiaccessoriespro
* **Impacted release**: <= 5.2.0 (5.3.0 fixed the vulnerability)
* **Product author**: Presta Monster
* **Weakness**: [CWE-89](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html)
* **Severity**: critical (9.8)

## Description

The method HsAccessoriesGroupProductAbstract::getAccessoriesByIdProducts() has a sensitive SQL call that can be executed with a trivial http call and exploited to forge a SQL injection.

This exploit uses a PrestaShop front controller and most attackers can conceal the module controller's path during the exploit, so you will never know within your conventional frontend logs that it exploits this vulnerability. **You will only see "POST /" inside your conventional frontend logs.** Activating the AuditEngine of mod_security (or similar) is the only way to get data to confirm this exploit.

## CVSS base metrics

* **Attack vector**: network
* **Attack complexity**: low
* **Privilege required**: none
* **User interaction**: none
* **Scope**: unchanged
* **Confidentiality**: high
* **Integrity**: high
* **Availability**: high

**Vector string**: [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

## Possible malicious usage

* Obtain admin access
* Remove data from the associated PrestaShop
* Copy/paste data from sensitive tables to FRONT to expose tokens and unlock admins's ajax scripts
* Rewrite SMTP settings to hijack emails


## Patch from 5.2.0

--- 5.2.0/modules/hsmultiaccessoriespro/abstract/classes/HsAccessoriesGroupProductAbstract.php
+++ 5.3.0/modules/hsmultiaccessoriespro/abstract/classes/HsAccessoriesGroupProductAbstract.php
```diff
...
            $query->from('accessory_group_product', 'agp');
-           $query->where('agp.`id_product` IN (' . implode(',', $id_products) . ')');
+           $query->where('agp.`id_product` IN (' . implode(',', array_map('intval', $id_products)) . ')');
            $query->where('ag.`active` = 1');
```

## Other recommendations

* It’s recommended to upgrade to the latest version of the module **hsmultiaccessoriespro**.
* Upgrade PrestaShop to the latest version to disable multiquery executions (separated by “;”) - be warned that this functionality **WILL NOT** protect your SHOP against injection SQL which uses the UNION clause to steal data.
* Change the default database prefix `ps_` with a new longer, arbitrary prefix. Nevertheless, be warned that this is useless against blackhats with DBA senior skills because of a design vulnerability in DBMS
* Activate OWASP 942's rules on your WAF (Web application firewall), be warned that you will probably break your backoffice and you will need to pre-configure some bypasses against this set of rules.
