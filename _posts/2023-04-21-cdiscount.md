## Other recommandations

* Itâ€™s recommended to upgrade to the lastest version of the module **cdiscount** up to 4.4.61

* Upgrade PrestaShop beyond 1.7.8.8 (and 8.0.2) to disable multiquery executions (separated by ";").
* Change the default database prefix `ps_` by a new longer arbitrary prefix. Nethertheless, be warned that this is useless against blackhat with DBA senior skill because of a design vulnerability in DBMS
* Activate OWASP 942's rules on your WAF (Web application firewall), be warned that you will probably break your backoffice and you will need to pre-configure some bypasses against these set of rules.
