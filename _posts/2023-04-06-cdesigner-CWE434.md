In the module "Cdesigner" (cdesigner) up to 3.2.1 (3.2.2 fix the issue), a guest can upload files with extensions \.php.+ (like .php7)

Note : .php extension is correctly block so it will be harmless for most servers's setups.

## Summary

* **CVE ID**: [CVE-2023-27033](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-27033)
* **Published at**: 2023-04-06
* **Platform**: PrestaShop
* **Product**: cdesigner
* **Impacted release**: > 3.1.3, <= 3.2.1 (3.2.2 fix the issue)
* **Product author**: Prestaeg
* **Weakness**: [CWE-434](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/434.html)
* **Severity**: critical (9.8)

## Description

Important : If you use default configuration for your server, *you should be safe* - which should be the case of the majority of servers, so don't worry too much about this CVE. 

*We are forced to tag it as critical since it will be critical for some setups, but for the majority, it should be completly harmless.*

You can check if you are vulnerable by uploading files with extensions : .php3 / .php4 / .php5 / .php7 / .php8 with this content : <?php echo (21+21); - when you make a HTTP call against theses files, if you do not see 42, all is OK else, you service is vulnerable, contact without delay your hoster.

The method `CdesignerSaverotateModuleFrontController::initContent()` misuses strpos which can lead to upload .phpX files, depending on your server's setup, which will lead to a critical vulnerability [CWE-94](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/94.html).

**This exploit is actively exploited in the wild**

**WARNING** : If your service is vulnerable, be warn that this exploit will bypass some WAF (base64 payloads)
