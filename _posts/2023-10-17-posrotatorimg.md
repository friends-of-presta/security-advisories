**WARNING** : This exploit is actively used to deploy a webskimmer to massively steal credit cards.

## CVSS base metrics

* **Attack vector**: network
* **Attack complexity**: low
* **Privilege required**: low
* **User interaction**: none
* **Scope**: unchanged
* **Confidentiality**: high
* **Integrity**: high
* **Availability**: high

**Vector string**: [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

## Possible malicious usage

* Obtain admin access
* Remove data from the associated PrestaShop
* Copy/paste data from sensitive tables to FRONT to expose tokens and unlock admins's ajax scripts
* Rewrite SMTP settings to hijack emails

## Patch from 1.1

```diff
--- 1.1/modules/posrotatorimg/ajax.php
+++ XXX/modules/posrotatorimg/ajax.php
        $params = $_POST; 

-       $id_product = $params['id_product'];
+       $id_product = (int) $params['id_product'];
        $action = $params['action'];
...
        $images= Image::getImages((int)Context::getContext()->language->id,$id_product);
-       $id = $params['img_id']; 
+       $id = (int) $params['img_id']; 
```

Be warn that there is other sensitives SQL calls inside this module accessible to administrators. Since there is thousand of injection SQL accessible to administrators on the PrestaShop's ecosystem, these vulnerabilities are ignored until author provide a patch.


## Other recommendations

* It’s recommended to apply patch given or delete the module (NB : disabled it is useless)
* Upgrade PrestaShop to the latest version to disable multiquery executions (separated by “;”) - be warned that this functionality **WILL NOT** protect your SHOP against injection SQL which uses the UNION clause to steal data.
* Change the default database prefix `ps_` with a new longer, arbitrary prefix. Nevertheless, be warned that this is useless against blackhats with DBA senior skill because of a design vulnerability in DBMS
* Activate OWASP 942's rules on your WAF (Web application firewall), be warned that you will probably break your backoffice and you will need to pre-configure some bypasses against this set of rules.
