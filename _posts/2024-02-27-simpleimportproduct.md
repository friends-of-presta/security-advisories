## Description

The method `Send::__construct()` allows the upload of .zip files, which can be auto uncompress in a predictable directory, author tries to protect it with a.htaccess, but since we can forge a zip with a custom .htaccess and a PHP payload, it will lead to a critical vulnerability [CWE-94](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/94.html).
