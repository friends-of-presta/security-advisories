In the module "Opart Devis" (opartdevis) up to version 4.6.12 from Opart for PrestaShop, a guest can perform SQL injection in affected versions.


## Summary

* **CVE ID**: [CVE-2023-48188](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-48188)
* **Published at**: 2023-11-23
* **Platform**: PrestaShop
* **Product**: opartdevis
* **Impacted release**: >= 4.5.18 & <= 4.6.12 (4.6.13 fixed the vulnerability)  
* **Product author**: Opart
* **Weakness**: [CWE-89](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html)
* **Severity**: critical (9.8)

## Description

The method `Translate::getModuleTranslation()` has a sensitive SQL call that can be executed with a trivial http call and exploited to forge a SQL injection.

This exploit uses a PrestaShop class stappled on all pages and most attackers can conceal the attack during the exploit, so you will never know within your conventional frontend logs that it exploits this vulnerability. **You will only see "POST /" inside your conventional frontend logs.** Activating the AuditEngine of mod_security (or similar) is the only way to get data to confirm this exploit.

## CVSS base metrics

* **Attack vector**: network
* **Attack complexity**: low
* **Privilege required**: none
* **User interaction**: none
* **Scope**: unchanged
* **Confidentiality**: high
* **Integrity**: high
* **Availability**: high

**Vector string**: [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

## Possible malicious usage

* Obtain admin access
* Remove data from the associated PrestaShop
* Copy/paste data from sensitive tables to FRONT to expose tokens and unlock admins's ajax scripts
* Rewrite SMTP settings to hijack emails

## Patch from 4.6.1

```diff
--- 4.6.1/modules/opartdevis/override/classes/Translate.php
+++ 4.6.2/modules/opartdevis/override/classes/Translate.php
...
                    LEFT JOIN '._DB_PREFIX_.'customer c ON c.id_customer = a.id_customer 
-                    WHERE id_opartdevis = '.Tools::getValue('id_opartdevis'));
+                    WHERE id_opartdevis = '.(int) Tools::getValue('id_opartdevis'));
                    $lang = new Language($id_lang);
```

Do not forget to check the installed override here : 

```diff
--- 4.6.1/override/classes/Translate.php
+++ 4.6.2/override/classes/Translate.php
...
                    LEFT JOIN '._DB_PREFIX_.'customer c ON c.id_customer = a.id_customer 
-                    WHERE id_opartdevis = '.Tools::getValue('id_opartdevis'));
+                    WHERE id_opartdevis = '.(int) Tools::getValue('id_opartdevis'));
                    $lang = new Language($id_lang);
```

## Other recommendations

* It’s recommended to upgrade to the latest version of the module **opartdevis**.
* Upgrade PrestaShop to the latest version to disable multiquery executions (separated by “;”) - be warned that this functionality **WILL NOT** protect your SHOP against injection SQL which uses the UNION clause to steal data.
* Change the default database prefix `ps_` with a new longer, arbitrary prefix. Nevertheless, be warned that this is useless against blackhats with DBA senior skills because of a design vulnerability in DBMS
* Activate OWASP 942's rules on your WAF (Web application firewall), be warned that you will probably break your backoffice and you will need to pre-configure some bypasses against this set of rules.
