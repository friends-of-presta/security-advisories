User enumeration vulnerability in the AdminLogin controller in PrestaShop 1.7 through 8.2.2 allows remote attackers to obtain administrators user email addresses via manipulation of the id_employee and reset_token parameters. An attacker who has access to the Back Office login URL can trigger the password reset form to disclose the associated email address in a hidden field, even when the provided reset token is invalid. This issue has been fixed in 8.2.3.

## Summary

- **CVE ID**: CVE-2025-51586
- **Published at**: 2025-09-04
- **Platform**: PrestaShop (Core)
- **Impacted release**: from 1.7 to 8.2.2 - **fixed in 8.2.3**
- **Product author**: PrestaShop
- **Weakness**: [CWE-359 – Exposure of Private Information (‘Privacy Violation’)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/359.html)
- **Severity**: Moderate.  
  - CVSS v3.1 base score: **4.2** (as assessed in the PrestaShop advisory)  
  - Based on the criteria applied in this advisory: **3.7 (Low)** (see vector string below)

**Root cause (before fix):** the template variables for the reset form were assigned without first verifying that the `reset_token` matched the employee’s currently valid reset token (including validity window).

## CVSS base metrics

- **Attack vector**: Network (AV:N)  
- **Attack complexity**: High (AC:H)  
- **Privileges required**: None (PR:N)  
- **User interaction**: None (UI:N)  
- **Scope**: Unchanged (S:U)  
- **Confidentiality**: Low (C:L)  
- **Integrity**: None (I:N)  
- **Availability**: None (A:N)  

**Vector string**: `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N` - **3.7 (Low)**

## Proof of concept

When an invalid `reset_token` is supplied together with a valid `id_employee`, the application still renders the password reset form and includes the employee’s email address in a hidden field. By incrementing or iterating through `id_employee` values, an attacker can systematically enumerate all Back Office user emails.

For security reasons, the full proof of concept request/response sequence is not fully disclosed here. The vulnerability cannot be reliably mitigated by common WAF rules, as the flaw resides in the application logic itself.

## Patch

Based on editor patch: https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/39479/commits/c97bdf10f77fedbe5a61a1dec5f96b3abb1d76fb

### Minimal logic hardening (as merged upstream)

Only render the reset form (and especially `reset_email`) if **both** parameters are present **and** the **token is valid** for the selected employee:

```diff
- // For reset password feature
- if ($reset_token = Tools::getValue('reset_token')) {
-     $this->context->smarty->assign('reset_token', $reset_token);
- }
- if ($id_employee = Tools::getValue('id_employee')) {
-     $this->context->smarty->assign('id_employee', $id_employee);
-     $employee = new Employee($id_employee);
-     if (Validate::isLoadedObject($employee)) {
-         $this->context->smarty->assign('reset_email', $employee->email);
-     }
- }
+ // For reset password feature (safe: only when token is valid)
+ $reset_token = Tools::getValue('reset_token');
+ $id_employee = Tools::getValue('id_employee');
+ if ($reset_token !== false && $id_employee !== false) {
+     $this->context->smarty->assign('reset_token', $reset_token);
+     $this->context->smarty->assign('id_employee', $id_employee);
+     $employee = new Employee((int) $id_employee);
+     if (Validate::isLoadedObject($employee)) {
+         $valid_reset_token = $employee->getValidResetPasswordToken();
+         if ($valid_reset_token !== false && hash_equals($valid_reset_token, (string) $reset_token)) {
+             $this->context->smarty->assign('reset_email', $employee->email);
+         }
+     }
+ }
```

Upstream fix is included in PrestaShop **8.2.3**.

## Other recommendations

- Enforce **rate limiting** on the password reset endpoint.
- Install a security module that enable **2FA** for BackOffice login.
- Keep your **Back Office URL secret** and rotate it if leaked. 
- Keep your PrestaShop up to date
