In the module "Opart Faq" (opartfaq) up to version 1.0.3 from Opart for PrestaShop, a guest can perform SQL injection in affected versions.


## Summary

* **CVE ID**: [CVE-2023-34576](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-34576)
* **Published at**: 2023-09-19
* **Platform**: PrestaShop
* **Product**: opartfaq
* **Impacted release**: <= 1.0.3 (1.0.4 fixed the vulnerability - WARNING : NO SEMVER VERSIONNING BEFORE 2018 - SEE NOTE BELOW)  
* **Product author**: Opart
* **Weakness**: [CWE-89](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html)
* **Severity**: critical (9.8)

## Description

The ajax script updatepos.php has a sensitive SQL call that can be executed with a trivial http call and exploited to forge a SQL injection.

Note : We didn't do semver versionning before 2018 - so consider all versions which matched this pattern : XX-XX-XX to be updated without delay.

## Possible malicious usage

* Obtain admin access
* Remove data from the associated PrestaShop
* Copy/paste data from sensitive tables to FRONT to expose tokens and unlock admins's ajax scripts
* Rewrite SMTP settings to hijack emails

## Patch from 1.0.3

```diff
--- 1.0.3/modules/opartfaq/updatepost.php
+++ 1.0.4/modules/opartfaq/updatepost.php
...
	Db::getInstance()->update('opartfaq_questions_products', array(
-			'position' => $value
+			'position' => (int) $value
-	),'id_product='.$_POST['opartFaqIdProductPos'].' AND id_opartfaq_questions='.$key);
+	),'id_product='. (int) $_POST['opartFaqIdProductPos'].' AND id_opartfaq_questions='. (int) $key);
```

## Other recommendations

* It’s recommended to upgrade to the latest version of the module **opartfaq**.
* Upgrade PrestaShop to the latest version to disable multiquery executions (separated by “;”) - be warned that this functionality **WILL NOT** protect your SHOP against injection SQL which uses the UNION clause to steal data.
* Change the default database prefix `ps_` with a new longer, arbitrary prefix. Nevertheless, be warned that this is useless against blackhats with DBA senior skills because of a design vulnerability in DBMS
* Activate OWASP 942's rules on your WAF (Web application firewall), be warned that you will probably break your backoffice and you will need to pre-configure some bypasses against this set of rules.
