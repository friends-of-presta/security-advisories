Modules include the vulnerable dependancy are: 
* 1-Click Upgrade (autoupgrade) from 4.0.0 to 4.10.1
* Cart Abandonment Pro (pscartabandonmentpro) from 2.0.1 to 2.0.10
* Faceted Search (ps_facetedsearch) from 2.2.1 to 3.4.1
* Merchant Expertise (gamification) from 2.1.0 to 2.3.2
* PrestaShop Checkout (ps_checkout) from 1.0.8 to 1.2.9

In addition, if PrestaShop had been initially installed prior to ~1.7.6.0 with composer in dev mode can contain a critical vulnerability if .htaccess in vendor directory is [not set in order to denied access](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/blob/develop/vendor/.htaccess).


## Summary

* **CVE ID**: [CVE-2017-9841](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-9841)
* **Published at**: 2020-01-20

* **Product author**: PrestaShop
* **Weakness**: [CWE-94](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/94.html)
* **Severity**: critical (9.8)

## Description
    
Util/PHP/eval-stdin.php in PHPUnit before 4.8.28 and 5.x before 5.6.3 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via HTTP POST data beginning with a "<?php " substring, as demonstrated by an attack on a site with an exposed /vendor folder, i.e., external access to the /vendor/phpunit/phpunit/src/Util/PHP/eval-stdin.php URI.

## Possible malicious usage

According to [PrestaShop team](https://build.prestashop-project.org/news/2020/critical-security-vulnerability-in-prestashop-modules/), this vulnerability has been exploited to add a malicious code.

"According to our analysis, most attackers either place new files in the filesystem or modify existing files, like AdminLoginController.php. Hereâ€™s a non-exhaustive list of known malicious files that may indicate a compromised shop: XsamXadoo_Bot.php, XsamXadoo_deface.php, 0x666.php, f.php, Xsam_Xadoo.html"

## Patch

Delete vulnerables files on your PrestaShop:

```diff
find . -type f -name "eval-stdin.php" -exec rm -rf {} \;
```
