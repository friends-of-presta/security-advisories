In the module "BLOG - Drive High Traffic & Boost SEO" (ybc_blog) in version up to 3.3.8 from PrestaHero (ETS Soft) for PrestaShop, a guest can perform SQL injection in affected versions.

## Summary

* **CVE ID**: [CVE-2023-43979](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-43979)
* **Published at**: 2023-11-14
* **Advisory source**: Friends-Of-Presta.org
* **Platform**: PrestaShop
* **Product**: ybc_blog
* **Impacted release**: <= 3.3.8 (4.4.0 fixed the vulnerability)
* **Product author**: PrestaHero (ETS Soft)
* **Weakness**: [CWE-89](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html)
* **Severity**: critical (9.8)

## Description

The method `Ybc_blogBlogModuleFrontController::getPosts()` has sensitive SQL calls that can be executed with a trivial http call and exploited to forge a SQL injection.

This exploit uses a PrestaShop front controller and most attackers can conceal the module controller's path during the exploit, so you will never know within your conventional frontend logs that it exploits this vulnerability. **You will only see "POST /" inside your conventional frontend logs.** Activating the AuditEngine of mod_security (or similar) is the only way to get data to confirm this exploit.

Reminder : Core method `Validate::isCleanHtml()` is useless against [CWE-89](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), it only targets [CWE-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)

**Vector string**: [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

## Possible malicious usage

* Obtain admin access
* Remove data from the associated PrestaShop
* Copy/paste data from sensitive tables to FRONT to expose tokens and unlock admins's ajax scripts
* Rewrite SMTP settings to hijack emails

## Patch from 3.3.8

```diff
--- 3.3.8/modules/ybc_blog/controllers/front/blog.php
+++ 4.4.0/modules/ybc_blog/controllers/front/blog.php
...
        } elseif (($tag = trim(Tools::getValue('tag'))) != '' && Validate::isCleanHtml($tag)) {
            if ($this->module->friendly && Tools::strpos($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'], 'tag') !== false && Tools::strpos($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'], 'ybc_blog') !== false)
                $this->module->redirect($this->module->getLink('blog', array('tag' => $tag)));
            $md5tag = md5(urldecode(trim(Tools::strtolower($tag))));
-           $filter .= " AND p.id_post IN (SELECT id_post FROM `" . _DB_PREFIX_ . "ybc_blog_tag` WHERE tag = '$tag' AND id_lang = " . $this->context->language->id . ")";
+           $filter .= " AND p.id_post IN (SELECT id_post FROM `" . _DB_PREFIX_ . "ybc_blog_tag` WHERE tag = '" . pSQL($tag) . "' AND id_lang = " . $this->context->language->id . ")";
```

## Other recommendations

* It’s recommended to upgrade to the latest version of the module **ybc_blog**.
* Upgrade PrestaShop to the latest version to disable multiquery executions (separated by “;”) - be warned that this functionality **WILL NOT** protect your SHOP against injection SQL which uses the UNION clause to steal data.
* Change the default database prefix `ps_` with a new longer, arbitrary prefix. Nevertheless, be warned that this is useless against blackhats with DBA senior skill because of a design vulnerability in DBMS
* Activate OWASP 942's rules on your WAF (Web application firewall), be warned that you will probably break your backoffice and you will need to pre-configure some bypasses against this set of rules.
