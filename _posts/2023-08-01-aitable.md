In the module "Attributes table" (aitable) for PrestaShop, an atacker can perform SQL injection up to 0.2.1. Release 0.2.2 fixed this security issue.

## Summary

* **CVE ID**: [CVE-2023-33665](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-33665)
* **Published at**: 2023-08-01
* **Advisory source**: Friends-Of-Presta.org
* **Platform**: PrestaShop
* **Product**: aitable
* **Impacted release**: <= 0.2.1 (0.2.2 fixed issue)
* **Product author**: ai-dev
* **Weakness**: [CWE-89](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html)
* **Severity**: critical (9.8)

## Description

Up to 0.2.2, a sensitive SQL calls in file `includes/ajax.php` can be executed with a trivial http call and exploited to forge a blind SQL injection throught the POST or GET submitted `attributes` variables.

## CVSS base metrics

* **Attack vector**: network
* **Attack complexity**: low
* **Privilege required**: low
* **User interaction**: none
* **Scope**: unchanged
* **Confidentiality**: high
* **Integrity**: high
* **Availability**: high

**Vector string**: [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)


## Possible malicious usage

* Technical and personal data leaks
* Obtain admin access
* Remove all data of the linked PrestaShop
* Display sensitives tables to front-office to unlock potential admin's ajax scripts of modules protected by token on the ecosystem


## Patch

```diff
--- a/modules/aitable/includes/ajax.php
+++ b/modules/aitable/includes/ajax.php
        $data = array();
        foreach ($lines as $line) {
            foreach ($columns as $col) {
                $result = Db::getInstance()->getRow(
                    'SELECT COUNT(pac.id_product_attribute) AS count, pa.* FROM '._DB_PREFIX_.'product_attribute AS pa LEFT JOIN '._DB_PREFIX_.'product_attribute_combination AS pac ON pac.id_product_attribute = pa.id_product_attribute WHERE '.
-                    'pac.id_attribute IN ('.pSql($attributes).','.(int)$line['id_attribute'].','.(int)$col['id_attribute'].') AND pa.id_product = '.(int)$product_id.' GROUP BY pa.id_product_attribute HAVING count = '.(int)$count
+                    'pac.id_attribute IN ('.implode(',', array_map('intval', explode(',', $attributes))).','.(int)$line['id_attribute'].','.(int)$col['id_attribute'].') AND pa.id_product = '.(int)$product_id.' GROUP BY pa.id_product_attribute HAVING count = '.(int)$count
                );
```


## Other recommandations

* Upgrade PrestaShop to the latest version to disable multiquery execution (separated by “;”) - be warned that this functionality **WILL NOT** protect your SHOP against injection SQL which uses the UNION clause to steal data.
* Change the default database prefix `ps_` by a new longer arbitrary prefix. Nevertheless, be warned that this is useless against blackhats with DBA senior skills because of a design vulnerability in DBMS
* Activate OWASP 942's rules on your WAF (Web application firewall), be warned that you will probably break your backoffice and you will need to pre-configure some bypasses against these set of rules.
