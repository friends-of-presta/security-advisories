In the module "KerAwen" (kerawen) up to version 2.3.81.1 from KerAwen for PrestaShop, an anonymous user can perform a SQL injection.


## Summary

* **CVE ID**: [CVE-2023-40922](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-40922)
* **Published at**: 2023-11-02
* **Platform**: PrestaShop
* **Product**: kerawen
* **Impacted release**: < 2.5.1 (2.5.1 fixed the vulnerability)
* **Product author**: Kerawen
* **Weakness**: [CWE-89](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html)
* **Severity**: critical (9.8)

## Description

The method `KerawenDeliveryModuleFrontController::initContent()` has a sensitive SQL call that can be executed with a trivial http call and exploited to forge a SQL injection.

This exploit uses a PrestaShop front controller and most attackers can conceal the module controller's path during the exploit, so you will never know within your conventional frontend logs that it exploits this vulnerability. **You will only see "POST /" inside your conventional frontend logs.** Activating the AuditEngine of mod_security (or similar) is the only way to get data to confirm this exploit.

**WARNING** : The exploit will bypass most WAF due to its design. Patch it quickly.

## CVSS base metrics

* **Attack vector**: network
* **Attack complexity**: low
* **Privilege required**: none
* **User interaction**: none
* **Scope**: unchanged
* **Confidentiality**: high
* **Integrity**: high
* **Availability**: high

**Vector string**: [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

## Possible malicious usage

* Obtain admin access
* Steal/Remove data from the associated PrestaShop
* Copy/paste data from sensitive tables to FRONT to expose tokens and unlock admins's ajax scripts
* Rewrite SMTP settings to hijack emails

                                                Db::getInstance()->execute(
                                                        'INSERT INTO `'._DB_PREFIX_.'cart_kerawen` (id_cart, delivery_date)
-                                                        VALUES ('. (int) $id_cart .', FROM_UNIXTIME('.$date.'))
+                                                        VALUES ('. (int) $id_cart .', FROM_UNIXTIME("'.pSQL($date).'"))
                                                        ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE delivery_date = VALUES(delivery_date)');
                                        }
                                        break;
```

## Other recommendations

* It’s recommended to upgrade to the latest version of the module **Kerawen**.
* Upgrade PrestaShop to the latest version to disable multiquery executions (separated by “;”) - be warned that this functionality **WILL NOT** protect your SHOP against injection SQL which uses the UNION clause to steal data.
* Change the default database prefix `ps_` with a new longer, arbitrary prefix. Nevertheless, be warned that this is useless against blackhats with DBA senior skill because of a design vulnerability in DBMS
* Activate OWASP 942's rules on your WAF (Web application firewall), be warned that you will probably break your backoffice and you will need to pre-configure some bypasses against this set of rules.
