## Summary

* **Platform**: PrestaShop
* **Product**: salesbooster
* **Impacted release**: <= 1.10.4 (1.10.5 fixed the vulnerability)
* **Product author**: Webbax
* **Weakness**: [CWE-22](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html)
* **Severity**: high (7.5)

## Description

Due to predictible token and a lack of control in the path name's construction, a guest can perform a path traversal to view all files on the information system.

Note : We are forced to tag it as a high gravity due to the CWE type 22 but be warned that on our ecosystem, it must be considered critical since it unlocks hundreds admin's ajax script of modules due to [this](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/blob/6c05518b807d014ee8edb811041e3de232520c28/classes/Tools.php#L1247)

**Vector string**: [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

## Possible malicious usage

* Stealing secrets to unlock admin controllers based on ajax script
* Exfiltrate all modules with all versions to facilited pentesting
* Stealing table_prefix to greatly facilitate SQL injections for kiddies who don't known how exploit DBMS design's vulnerabilities or stealing database access to login in exposed PHPMyAdmin / Adminer / etc.
* Bypass WAF / htaccess restrictions to read forbidden files (such as logs on predictible paths of banks's modules inside /var/log/)

## Patch from 1.10.4

```diff
--- 1.10.4/modules/salesbooster/downloads/download.php
+++ 1.10.5/modules/salesbooster/downloads/download.php
...
-$file = Tools::getValue('file');
+$file = basename(Tools::getValue('file')).'.txt';
+if((strpos($file, './') === false) && substr($file,-4) == '.txt'){
...
+}
...
```

## Other recommandations

* Itâ€™s recommended to upgrade to the latest version of the module **salesbooster**.
* Update the configuration SALESBOOSTER_TOKEN in your ps_configuration table with a string not predictible - **be warned that the patch provided by author still suffer of a predictible security token mecanism.**
* You should consider to restrict the access of modules/salesbooster/ to a whitelist
* NEVER exposed a PHPMyAdmin / Adminer / etc without, at least, a htpasswd
* Activate OWASP 930's rules on your WAF (Web application firewall) and adjust it for your Prestashop
