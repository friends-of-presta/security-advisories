In the module "Product Designer" (productdesigner) up to version 1.178.36 from Tunis Soft for PrestaShop, a guest can execute a remote code via un untrusted data deserialized.


## Summary

* **CVE ID**: [CVE-2024-24302](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-24302)
* **Published at**: 2024-02-29
* **Platform**: PrestaShop
* **Product**: productdesigner
* **Impacted release**: < 1.178.36 (1.178.36 fixed the vulnerability)
* **Product author**: Tunis Soft
* **Weakness**: [CWE-918](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/918.html)
* **Severity**: critical (10)

## Description

Prior to PHP 8.0, a deserialization of untrusted data exploiting phar wrapper, in the method `ProductDesignerPixabayModuleFrontController::postProcess()` can be used with a trivial http call and exploited to execute a remote code.

This exploit uses a PrestaShop front controller and most attackers can conceal the module controller's path during the exploit, so you will never know within your conventional frontend logs that it exploits this vulnerability. **You will only see "POST /" inside your conventional frontend logs.** Activating the AuditEngine of mod_security (or similar) is the only way to get data to confirm this exploit.

## Possible malicious usage

* Obtain admin access
* Steal/Remove data from the associated PrestaShop

## Other recommendations

* Itâ€™s recommended to upgrade the module to its latest version
* Activate OWASP 933's rules on your WAF (Web application firewall), be warned that you will probably break your backoffice and you will need to pre-configure some bypasses against this set of rules.
