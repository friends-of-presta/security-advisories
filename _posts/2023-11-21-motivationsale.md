In the module "Cross Selling in Modal Cart" (motivationsale) from MyPrestaModules for PrestaShop, a guest can perform SQL injection in affected versions.

## Summary

* **CVE ID**: [CVE-2023-46357](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-46357)
* **Published at**: 2023-11-21
* **Advisory source**: Friends-Of-Presta.org
* **Platform**: PrestaShop
* **Product**: motivationsale
* **Impacted release**: < 3.5.0 (3.5.0 fixed the vulnerability - see note below)
* **Product author**: MyPrestaModules
* **Weakness**: [CWE-89](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html)
* **Severity**: critical (9.8)

## Description

The method `motivationsaleDataModel::getProductsByIds()` has sensitive SQL calls that can be executed with a trivial http call and exploited to forge a SQL injection.

Note : The author has deleted from its module the files that have been suffering from critical vulnerabilities for months, BUT did not set them to be "auto-deleted" during upgrades. Therefore, there are likely merchants out there with older versions who have updated their modules, thinking they are safe. However, there is nothing safe about this, since past upgrades did not auto-delete the implicated files. To ensure everyone has a "safe version", we decided to mark all versions up to 3.5.0 as impacted by this issue.

## Possible malicious usage

* Obtain admin access
* Remove data from the associated PrestaShop
* Copy/paste data from sensitive tables to FRONT to expose tokens and unlock admins's ajax scripts
* Rewrite SMTP settings to hijack emails

## Patch from 3.2.3

```diff
--- 3.2.3/modules/motivationsale/datamodel.php
+++ XXXXX/modules/motivationsale/datamodel.php
...
  public static function getProductsByIds($product_ids)
  {
    $sql = '
			SELECT pl.name, p.*, i.id_image, pl.link_rewrite, p.reference
      FROM ' . _DB_PREFIX_ . 'product_lang as pl
      LEFT JOIN ' . _DB_PREFIX_ . 'image as i
      ON i.id_product = pl.id_product AND i.cover=1
      INNER JOIN ' . _DB_PREFIX_ . 'product as p
      ON p.id_product = pl.id_product
      WHERE pl.id_lang = ' . (int)self::$id_lang . '
      AND pl.id_shop = ' . (int)self::$id_shop . '
-     AND p.id_product IN ('.pSQL($product_ids).')
+     AND p.id_product IN ('.implode(',', array_map('intval', explode(',',$product_ids))).')
```

## Other recommendations

* It’s recommended to upgrade to the latest version of the module **motivationsale**.
* Upgrade PrestaShop to the latest version to disable multiquery executions (separated by “;”) - be warned that this functionality **WILL NOT** protect your SHOP against injection SQL which uses the UNION clause to steal data.
* Change the default database prefix `ps_` with a new longer, arbitrary prefix. Nevertheless, be warned that this is useless against blackhats with DBA senior skill because of a design vulnerability in DBMS
* Activate OWASP 942's rules on your WAF (Web application firewall), be warned that you will probably break your backoffice and you will need to pre-configure some bypasses against this set of rules.
