In the module "Account Manager | Sales Representative & Dealers | CRM" (prestasalesmanager) up to version 8.0.0 from Presta World for PrestaShop, a guest can delete all files of the system.


## Summary

* **CVE ID**: [CVE-2024-25842](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-25842)
* **Published at**: 2024-02-29
* **Platform**: PrestaShop
* **Product**: prestasalesmanager
* **Impacted release**: <= 8.0.0 (9.0.0 fixed the vulnerability)
* **Product author**: Presta World
* **Weakness**: [CWE-73](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/73.html)
* **Severity**: critical (9.1)

## Description

Methods `PrestaSalesManagerChatboxModuleFrontController::uploadLogo()` and `PrestaSalesManagerMyAccountManagerTabModuleFrontController::postProcess` has sensitive fopen call that can be executed with a trivial http call and exploited to delete all files of the system.

This exploit uses a PrestaShop front controller and most attackers can conceal the module controller's path during the exploit, so you will never know within your conventional frontend logs that it exploits this vulnerability. **You will only see "POST /" inside your conventional frontend logs.** Activating the AuditEngine of mod_security (or similar) is the only way to get data to confirm this exploit.
