WARNING : We are forced to tag it as a medium gravity due to the CWE type 22 but be warned that on our ecosystem, it must be considered critical since it unlocks hundreds admin's ajax script of modules due to this : https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/blob/6c05518b807d014ee8edb811041e3de232520c28/classes/Tools.php#L1247.

## Possible malicious usage

* Stealing secrets to unlock admin controllers based on ajax script
* Exfiltrate all modules with all versions to facilited pentesting
* Stealing table_prefix to greatly facilitate SQL injections for kiddies who don't known how exploit DBMS design's vulnerabilities or stealing database access to login in exposed PHPMyAdmin/Adminer/etc.
* Bypass WAF / htaccess restrictions to read forbidden files (such as logs on predictible paths of banks's modules inside /var/log/)


## Patch from 1.6.6

```diff
--- 1.6.6/modules/myinventory/downloads/download.php
+++ 1.6.7/modules/myinventory/downloads/download.php
- $file = Tools::getValue('file');
+ $file = basename(Tools::getValue('file')).'.csv';

+if((strpos($file, './') === false) && substr($file,-4) == '.csv'){
...
+}

## Other recommandations

* You should consider to restrict the access of modules/myinventory/ to a whitelist or delete the module
* NEVER exposed a PHPMyAdmin / Adminer / etc without, at least, a htpasswd
* Activate OWASP 930's rules on your WAF (Web application firewall) and adjust it for your Prestashop
