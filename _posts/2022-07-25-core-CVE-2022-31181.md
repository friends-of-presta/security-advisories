## Possible malicious usage

According to [PrestaShop team](https://build.prestashop-project.org/news/2022/major-security-vulnerability-on-prestashop-websites/), this vulnerability has been exploited to add a malicious code.

"After the attackers successfully gained control of a shop, they injected a fake payment form on the front-office checkout page. In this scenario, shop customers might enter their credit card information on the fake form, and unknowingly send it to the attackers."

## Patch

Delete the MySQL Smarty cache feature by removing these lines in the file config/smarty.config.inc.php lines 43-46 (PrestaShop 1.7) or 40-43 (PrestaShop 1.6):

```diff
--- a/config/smarty.config.inc.php
+++ a/config/smarty.config.inc.php
@@ -40,10 +40,6 @@ $smarty->use_sub_dirs = true;
 $smarty->setConfigDir(_PS_SMARTY_DIR_.'configs');
 $smarty->caching = false;
 
-if (Configuration::get('PS_SMARTY_CACHING_TYPE') == 'mysql') {
-    include _PS_CLASS_DIR_.'Smarty/SmartyCacheResourceMysql.php';
-    $smarty->caching_type = 'mysql';
-}
 $smarty->force_compile = (Configuration::get('PS_SMARTY_FORCE_COMPILE') == _PS_SMARTY_FORCE_COMPILE_) ? true : false;
 $smarty->compile_check = (Configuration::get('PS_SMARTY_FORCE_COMPILE') >= _PS_SMARTY_CHECK_COMPILE_) ? true : false;
 $smarty->debug_tpl = _PS_ALL_THEMES_DIR_.'debug.tpl';

```

Or upgrade up to 1.7.8.7.

## Other recommendations

* Upgrade PrestaShop to the latest version to disable multiquery executions (separated by “;”)
* Configure CSP headers (content security policies) by listing  externals domains allowed to load assets (such as js files) or being called in XHR transactions (Ajax).
* Change the default database prefix `ps_` by a new longer arbitrary prefix. Nevertheless, be warned that this is useless against blackhats with DBA senior skill because of a design vulnerability in DBMS
* Activate OWASP 942's rules on your WAF (Web application firewall), be warned that you will probably break your backoffice and you will need to pre-configure some bypasses against these set of rules.
